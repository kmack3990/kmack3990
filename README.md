Hello, My Name is Kiley Mack
=====================================================================================


Science Educator/Leader/Researcher turned Data Scientist/Analyst - Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since being introduced to coding by some students in my STEM Club in 2018, coding with Python and its libraries has a been a hobby of mine.  In 2022, I decided to make this hobby a career path.  In December 2022, I graduated from BrainStation with a Diploma in Data Science.  

As a science educator, researcher, and leader, I have observed how important it is to have the proper tools and processes to analyze data and make sound conclusions. I am invigorated by my knowledge of modern data science methods and look forward to leveraging them to make intelligent decisions that lead to sustainable results. 

In this quest for sustainable results, I continue to build on my skills to wrangle, analyze, model, and present the data that is ever evolving in today's industries. Some of this growing expertise includes:

â€¢ Fluency in coding languages, such as SQL, Python and Bash
â€¢ Construction of data visualizations and dashboards using Tableau and Matplotlib, Plotly, and Bokeh
â€¢ Modeling and machine learning with Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow

* :computer: I am looking to work in the Denver, CO or remotely 
* ðŸ”­ Currently, I am working on the WiDS Datathon Challenge
* ðŸ§  I am also learning everything data science/analytics
* :sunrise_over_mountains:	 I love to be outside with friends and family hiking, biking, or skiing
